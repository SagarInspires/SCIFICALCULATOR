**Scientific Calculator for CS112**

This project is a scientific calculator developed in C language as part of the CS112 course curriculum. The calculator provides a wide range of mathematical functionalities, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, memory functions, support for complex numbers, unit conversion capabilities, and more.

### Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
- Exponential and logarithmic functions
- Parentheses support for complex expressions
- Error handling for invalid input
- Square root and factorial functions
- Memory functions (store, recall)
- Support for complex numbers
- Unit conversion capabilities (length, mass, temperature)
- Error handling for divide by zero and other edge cases
- Scientific notation support
- Functionality to save and load calculations
- Linear regression for simple data analysis
- And many more

### To-Do List:
1. ❌Implement additional mathematical functions (e.g., cube root, power).
2. ❌ Enhance user interface for improved user experience.
3. ❌Implement statistical functions (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
4. ❌Add support for matrix operations (e.g., addition, multiplication).
5. ❌Implement graphing capabilities for visualizing functions.
6. ❌Add support for solving equations and inequalities.
7. ❌Implement calculus functions (e.g., derivative, integral).
8. ❌Enhance error handling to provide more informative error messages.
9. ❌Improve performance by optimizing algorithms and data structures.
10. ❌Implement unit tests to ensure accuracy and reliability.
11. ❌Others
